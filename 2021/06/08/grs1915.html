    <p><p>Bri Mills led a project to fit RXTE observations of GRS 1915+105 with accretion disk models to estimate the black hole spin while accounting for uncertainties in the distance to the source.  The plot on the left shows a number of samples of the distance to the source, observer inclination, and black hole mass.  The points are distributed according to uncertainties on the measured distance.  The blue points represent system parameters for which good fits are possible while the red points represent poor fits.  The black cross shows the results for the most likely system parameters.  The panel in the lower right shows a histogram of the best fit spin, providing a sense of the uncertainty in the best-fit spin due to the uncertainty in the system parameters.</p>
