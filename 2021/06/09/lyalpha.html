    <p><p>Connor McClellan is leading a project to construct semi-analytic solutions for the escape of Lyman <var>&alpha;</var> photons from a uniform, optically thick sphere.  Comparison with Monte Carlo calculations shows excellent agreement for sufficiently large line center optical depths.  We plan to use these semi-analytic solution as the basis for an acceleration scheme in future Monte Carlo calculations.  The plot on the left shows a comparison of binned Monte Carlo datapoints with a semi-analytic solution (green curve) for a line center optical depth of 10<sup>7</sup>. The x-axis shows photon frequency in Doppler widths. The photons are launched with different initial frequencies (grey vertical line) in the different panels. Our new solution includes a proper treatment of the boundary condition that provides better agreement with the Monte Carlo results.</p>
