    <p><p>Xiaoshan Huang led a project to study the effects of an applied flux of cosmic rays on an initially hydrostatic atmosphere.  Her numerical simulation results show that if the cosmic ray flux exceeds a characteristic value large outflows of mass will be accelerated by the cosmic ray pressure gradients that form, restructuring the atmosphere.  The plot on the left shows the 2D density distribution of the gas in a series of runs with cosmic ray flux increasing from left to right. The higher flux runs have more extended density distributions due to the outflow. One can see inhomogenities forming due to the cosmic ray acoustic instability.</p>
