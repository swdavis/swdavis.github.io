    <p>Connor joined the group shortly after arriving as a UVa astronomy graduate student in the fall of 2019.  His current primary research project uses semi-analytic solutions and Monte Carlo methods to study the radiation transfer of Lyman <var>&alpha;</var> in the irradiated atmospheres of extrasolar planets.  He is co-advised by <a href="https://uva.theopenscholar.com/phil-arras/">Phil Arras</a>.</p>

    <big>Xiaoshan Huang</big><br>
    <p>Xiaoshan is a graduate student in the UVa astronomy department.  She joined the group in the fall of 2017 and has worked primarily on studying the role radiation and cosmic ray pressure play in driving galactic outflows. She uses the Athena++ radiation and cosmic ray modules to perform large parallel numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of these (and other) systems.</p>

    <big>Brianna (Bri) Mills</big><br>
    <p>Bri is a UVa astronomy graduate student who joined the group in 2018. Her work focuses on bridging the gap between numerical simulations of black hole accretion and spectral data from observations of accreting black sources.  She has been using the Athena++ Monte Carlo module to generate synthetic spectra but has also used accretion disk spectral models to fit the spectrum of black hole X-ray binary GRS-1950+105.</p>

    <big>Dong Zhang</big><br>
    <p>Dong came to the group as a research associate after completing his graduate studies at the Ohio State University.  His research while at UVa focused primarily on numerical simulations of galaxy scale outflows and feedback from star formation.  After leaving UVa, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the U. of Michigan and now works in the field of data science.</p>
